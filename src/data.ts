  "Since more than 80 percent of Masterbatches orders are custom formulations, rigorous quality control is essential and we understand that more than anyone. In the process industry, masterbatches are used as 1-5% of overall products to mix in the product. In such a scenario, customers are very demanding in their requirements and specifications. Our Unit is ISO 9001:20015 certified. We have also initiated Total Quality Management (TQM) in masterbatch manufacturing.";
